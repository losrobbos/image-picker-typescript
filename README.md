# Image Picker

- Create a component that lets one pick an image by clicking the image
- Pass in a default image as prop
- Once selected: Convert image to string (=> base64 encoded Data-URI)
- Pass the string up by a prop
- Make the image style configurable from "outside" by props, e.g.
  - style prop
  - className
  - onClick
  - etc
